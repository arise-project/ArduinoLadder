ArduinoLadder
=============

GUI application to create Arduino programs using ladder logic (like a PLC).

I will update this readme and create a wiki once I get all the files in the repository.
In the meanwhile, you will find some docs in the Documents directory.

I created this solutoin in Xamarin studio but it should also work in visual studio if you have mono installed.

The code uses C# and Mono, GTK, and the Cairo framework. It should run on Windows, Linux, and MacOS (I only tested it in Windows and Linux).

IT REQUIRES THE ARDUINO IDE (version 1.0.6 or later) to compile and upload programs.

Thank you for your patience
